# My Resumé Website.

This is my resumé website, which I host on Github as my user/organization site.

You can view it live [here](https://salemandreus.github.io) .

### Now In Django
My Resumé Website now also has a [Django version repo](https://github.com/salemandreus/resume-website-django) .

The Django version isn't currently hosted live (GitHub Pages doesn't support full dynamic sites). It is optimised but looks the same visually.
